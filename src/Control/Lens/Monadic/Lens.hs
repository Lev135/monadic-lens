{- | The class of 'Functor's @t@, for which traverse-like function for specific
  applicative functor @f@.

  For trivial @f = Identity@ we should get 'fmap' up to 'coerce'.
  @instance Functor f => TraversableLike f t@ is not provided though, since in
  this case it should be INCOHERENT.

  Since type @f@ is restricted only one law from "Data.Traversable" is preserved:

  [Naturality]
    @t . 'traverseLike' f â‰¡ 'traverseLike' (t . f)@
    for every applicative transformation @t@
-}
class (Applicative f, Functor t) => TraversableLike f t where
  traverseLike :: (a -> f b) -> t a -> f (t b)

{- | This instance is marked as OVERLAPPABLE to escape type errors, when @t@
  is actually not 'Traversable'. However, for real 'Traversable's this instance
  is not expected to be overwritten.
-}
instance {-# OVERLAPPABLE #-} (Applicative f, Traversable t) => TraversableLike f t where
  traverseLike = traverse

{- | @Kleisli m a@ is not a 'Traversable' (and even not 'Foldable').
  However we can define 'traverseLike' function for it's monad @m@.
-}
instance (Monad m) => TraversableLike m (Kleisli m a) where
  traverseLike h = pure . Kleisli . (h <=<) . runKleisli

{- | Convenient derivative from 'traverseLike' function for monads.
  For trivial @m = `Identity`@ is isomorphic to `fmap`, for trivial
  @f = `Identity`@ to monadic bind operator `>>=`.
